Suggestion:
How much damage can the magic sword use? Is the player able to use it?
We need to add the damage amount each item is, same with some npcs/enemies. 
Princess asks you to bring her the magic sword so she can get rid of all the bandits in the land
Boxer asks you for help taking down the princess, says the bandits are a result of poor social services and high taxes forcing people to turn to crime
Bring Boxer to the revolutionary camp and get Boxer's horn, which has an attack description of a bunch of horses charging
princess is final fight, team up with boxer for good end
